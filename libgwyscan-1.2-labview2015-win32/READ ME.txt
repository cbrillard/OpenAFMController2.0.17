These routines are Labview VIs for the Gwyscan libaray. They are written in Labview 2015 and will not work with earlier versions of Labview. 
Please install them in the User.lib folder associated with Labview. Normally this can be found 

...\program files\National Instruments\Labview 2015\user.lib

The help files associated with the VIs should have the same content as that for the original C routines that can be found at

http://libgwyscan.sourceforge.net/

Please note the the routines are used at your own risk and that the authors accept no responsibility for problems encountered when using these routines.
